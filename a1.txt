To learn data structures and algorithms in 3 months, focus on the following condensed study plan:

**Weeks 1-2: Fundamentals**

* Learn basic concepts: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary search tree, AVL tree), graphs
* Understand algorithmic thinking: time complexity, space complexity, Big O notation

**Weeks 3-4: Data Structures**

* Study advanced data structures:
 + Heaps
 + Hash tables
 + Trie
 + Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's)
* Practice implementing data structures in a programming language

**Weeks 5-6: Algorithms**

* Learn and implement common algorithms:
 + Sorting (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort)
 + Searching (linear search, binary search)
 + Dynamic programming
 + Greedy algorithms
 + Recursion
* Focus on understanding algorithmic trade-offs and complexities

**Week 7-12: Practice and Review**

* Practice solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeForces
* Review and reinforce concepts through practice exercises and projects
* Focus on applying knowledge to real-world problems
